*Recipes for the images used on manifestos.org.uk*

## Introduction

This was the best way I could come up with for turning various multi-page PDF documents into corresponding groups of
JPEGs, one for each page.

## Page numbering

These makefiles create image files for numbered pages, such as `page-1.jpg`. The page numbers in these
names of these should match the actually page numbers visible within the images. Thus these images
(and manifestos.org.uk in general) are "compatible" with the printed copes of the manifestos and more useful as
common references.

## Contribute

If you're good at `make` then please suggest improvements.
